- 👋 Hi, I’m @pk50sshowa
- 👀 I’m interested in ... transitioning to a career from Japanese interpreting/translating to becoming a programmer, keeping some of my skills in the former realm in my progression to the latter.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... JavaScript, node.js, interfacing with various APIs, and any other languages necessary to get in the front door. I finished a boot camp program with UCLA Extension in August 2023.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any help with projects that will help build my portfolio in order to gain a position as a full-time front end developer.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Here on Github, or by email at paul＠pjkoehler.com
