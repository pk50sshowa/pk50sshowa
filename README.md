- 👋 Hi, I’m @pk50sshowa
- 👀 I’m interested in ... transitioning to a career from Japanese interpreting/translating to program, keeping some of my skills in the former realm in my progression to the latter.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... (re-learning HTML), C++, CSS, Javascript, Python and any other languages necessary to get in the front door. I have been working on coding exercises on freecodecamp.org and plan on entering a part-time coding bootcamp at the beginning of next year.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any help with projects that will help build my portfolio in order to gain a position as a full-time junior front-end developer.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Here on Github, or by email at paul.koehler@gmail.com
